# Artificial Intelligence Final Project “Deep Learning Modeling for Wind Power Prediction”

One of the main goals of “Artificial Intelligence” class is to prepare you to apply deep learning algorithms to real-world tasks, or to leave you well-qualified to start AI research. The final project is intended to be a individual project.

**Due date:   Between 13th and 15th week**  

**Project Parts: Develop Project and Final Report**
Submission: We’ll be using GitHub for submission of all parts of the final project.
- Your answers have to be uploaded to kaggle.com



## Develop  Project  << Jupyter Notebook
1. Prepare the problem

The first step in not just an machine learning but any project is to simply define the problem at hand. You first need to understand the situation and the problem which needs to be solved. And then devise how Machine Learning would solve that efficiently. Once you know the problem well, you then head on to solve it.

2. Data Handling/Cleaning

•	Load Libraries

•	Load Datasets          

•	Data Cleaning         

3. Summarize Data

•	Descriptive statistics

•	Data visualizations

4. Evaluate Algorithms

•	Split-out validation dataset

o	Train-Validation-Test sets

o	Evaluation Metrics:   *RMSE*, MAE, and R2

•	Deep Learning Algorithms 

o	Linear Regression

o	Neural Networks

o	Convolutional Neural Networks.

o	Etc.


## Final Report >= 6 pages

** 1. Abstract [≈ 1 paragraph] **
It should consist of 1 paragraph consisting of the motivation for your project and a high-level explanation of the methodology you used/results obtained.

** 2. Introduction [≈ 0.5 pages]** 
Explain the problem and why it is important. Discuss your motivation for pursuing this problem. Give some background if necessary. Clearly state what the input and output is. Be very explicit: “The input to our algorithm is an {Day, Month, Time, etc.}. We then use a {Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, linear regression, etc.} to output a predicted {Energy Forecast}.”

** 3. Dataset and Features [≈ 0.5 − 1 pages]** 
Describe your dataset: how many training/validation/test examples do you have? Is there any preprocessing you did? What about normalization or data augmentation? Show some examples from your dataset and a table that list the features, you should also talk about the features. If you extracted features using any algorithm, make sure to talk about it. Try to include examples of your data in the report (e.g. include graphs of the exploratory analysis.)

** 4. Methods [≈ 1 − 1.5 pages]** 
Describe your learning algorithms, proposed algorithm(s), or theoretical proof(s). For each algorithm, give a short description (≈ 1 paragraph) of how it works. Again, we are looking for your understanding of how these deep learning algorithms work. Additionally, if you are using a deep learning algorithm not covered in the class (e.g. transformers or any other deep learning algorithm), you may want to explain your algorithm using 1/2 paragraphs. 

** 5. Experiments/Results/Discussion [≈ 1 − 3 pages]** 
You should also give details about what (hyper)parameters you chose and how you chose them. Before you list your results, make sure to list and explain what your primary performance metrics are: MAE, RMSE and R2. Provide equations for the metrics if necessary. For results, you want to have a mixture of tables and plots. 
For regression problems, state the average error. You should have both quantitative and qualitative results. Include visualizations of results, heatmaps, examples of where your algorithm failed, and a discussion of why certain algorithms failed or succeeded. In addition, explain whether you think you have overfit to your training set and what, if anything, you did to mitigate that. Make sure to discuss the figures/tables in your main text throughout this section. Your plots should include legends, axis labels, and have font sizes that are legible when printed.

** 6. Conclusion/Future Work [≈ 1 − 2 paragraphs]** 
Summarize your report and reiterate key points. Which algorithms were the highest performing? Why do you think that some algorithms worked better than others? For future work, if you had more time, more team members, or more computational resources, what would you explore?

**Formatting**
Feel free to adjust the specific sections according to your needs (e.g. combine introduction and related work or separate the experiments from the discussion. The paper size is standard A4 or 8.5 x 11 inches. Your font size must be equal to Arial 10pt. Do not use less than 0.5 inch margins. I highly recommend using a conference/journal template (e.g. NIPS, IEEE, ICML). They generally provide a .doc templates. When you submit your final report send a .doc and PDF format.
